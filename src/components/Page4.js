                Dear HR:

                I am interested in the Software Engineer position. I recently completed rigorous courses from the Flatiron School’s Software Engineering Bootcamp and received my certification.
                <br />
                <br />

                I mainly focused on two languages: React in JavaScript, Rails on Ruby (back-end) and SQL during the bootcamp and I am currently learning Python and Java to broaden my skills set. Throughout the program, my communication and coding skills strengthened as I’ve collaborated with avid individuals in group-based projects.
                <br />
                <br />
                I have 4 years of managerial experiences in the office-setting which involved working in a fast-paced environment with demanding deadlines. As someone who is creative, tech-savvy and meticulous to detail, I can comprehend and develop new skills readily. Greater details of what I can offer and of my accomplishments can be found on my resume.
                My goal right now is to launch my career in tech and be a part of an exceptional company,
                where I can be grow and further my skills as a software engineer. I look forward to an opportunity to discuss my potential contribution to your company. I can be reached by phone and email.
                <br />
                <br />
                Sincerely,
                <br />

                Seungil Choi
